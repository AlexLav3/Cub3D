We can put questions, ideas, concerns in here, so we don't have to send 300 messages on slack. 

Alex: It seems that the texture is being put with the wrong width, I can see the colors are from the texture, but it seems 
overly "thin" if you get what I mean. 
Also I was thinking what do we want to do with spaces, I think rendering them as walls makes more sense, 
bc if there is a space in between the walls (that is allowed) we can't just have a random void or smt. It would seem like you can go there
And it would look weird. 

I fixed the movement - once you'd rotate, WASD keys would rotate instead of move. 
I didn't find any seg faults, map validation seems okay for now. 

Also, why are we using pixel put instead of putting each texture image? (as I read, pixel put is  not recommended for use) 
and where to put it and if it's visible, should be doable anyway, no?
