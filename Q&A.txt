We can put questions, ideas, concerns in here, so we don't have to send 300 messages on slack. 

Alex: I was thinking what do we want to do with spaces, I think rendering them as walls makes more sense, 
bc if there is a space in between the walls (that is allowed) we can't just have a random void or smt. It would seem like you can go there
And it would look weird.

I didn't find any seg faults, map validation seems okay for now.
