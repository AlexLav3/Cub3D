textures we find interesting, we can put subfolders in this folder, we can add them as jpg or whatever initially, just to consider if we both
want to use them and we like them. 
If yes, we'll convert to xpm.

I already put some other textures in textures2, bc they seem a bit easier to understand when being rendered, the other one looked so off rn it was trippy
